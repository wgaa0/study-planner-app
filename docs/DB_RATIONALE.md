The database is designed around a relational model to ensure data integrity, scalability, and clear separation of responsibilities.

- **Users:** Core entity that owns courses, tasks, events, and resources.

- **Courses:** Represent subjects or learning modules, linked to users.

- **Tasks:** Track progress within courses, with status and due dates for time management.

- **Events:** Calendar-based activities, linked to users, courses, or tasks, supporting planning and scheduling.

- **Resources:** Uploaded study materials, tied to users and courses.

Relationships use foreign keys with cascading rules to preserve referential integrity (e.g., deleting a user removes their courses, tasks, and events). The structure balances normalization (avoiding duplication) with usability (easy joins for common queries).
